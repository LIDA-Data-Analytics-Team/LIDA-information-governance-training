# Data Protection

Welcome to the University of Leeds Data Protection module. This is for staff, postgraduate researchers, contractors, and visitors who have access to University information. The module should take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete.

## 1. Introduction

### Why is data protection important?
In its role as an educational provider, an employer, and a research-intensive organization, the University holds and processes a significant volume of personal data relating to numerous cohorts of individuals. Everybody who processes personal data has a responsibility to do so safely and responsibly. If the University were to lose or otherwise compromise someone's personal data, it could not only have a serious effect on the rights and privacy of the individual but also on the reputation of the University as a safe partner for data sharing and use.

### Why complete the learning?
It is important that everybody remains focused on how we use and protect data. You are required to complete this training within 4 weeks of joining the University and on an annual basis thereafter. If you do not complete the training, your access to the University's systems may be suspended. Completing the learning is a key step in ensuring that the University remains compliant with all data protection legislation, and that we keep our data secure.

## 2. Data protection basics

### What is data protection?
Let’s start by making sure that we all have a shared understanding of what is meant by data protection and how we define personal data. We will then move on to review the six principles of data protection, consider individuals’ rights, and finally, learn who enforces data protection in the UK.

**Data protection means:**
- that the use of personal and special category (sensitive) information is strictly controlled
- that information is not put at risk of unauthorized or unlawful processing and is protected against accidental loss, destruction, or deletion
- that we must have a lawful basis to process personal data.

**Data protection rules specify:**
- that individuals have rights associated with the information held about them
- that there is a means of enforcing best practice, via the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if necessary.

### The legislation in brief
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises all countries in the EU plus Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. The UK is no longer one of those countries but our domestic Data Protection law (the Data Protection Act 2018) is equal to the GDPR. This means that we can continue to send data to our EEA partners, and they can send it back to us. Where we want to share data with partners and collaborators outside the EEA, we might need to include extra conditions and clauses in our contracts to provide added assurance that their data protection practices are adequate.

### Implications for individuals and organizations
**Rights to control:** The legislation gives individuals more rights to control and check how organizations use their personal information.
**Fines for breaches:** The legislation means that organizations could face higher fines for breaches in data protection.
**Security obligations:** Organizations will have even stricter obligations to keep the personal information that they hold safe and secure from loss and theft etc.
**Evidenced measures:** Organizations need to provide evidence of the measures they take to comply with the GDPR and the DPA 2018.

There is more information and useful resources such as document templates on the University’s data protection website.

### Personal data
The data protection legislation controls the use of personal data. But how do we define ‘personal data'?

**Definition of personal data:**
The data protection legislation describes personal data as such: “Personal data is a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.”
A simpler definition might be: Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

**The format of personal data:**
The data protection legislation applies to data stored digitally, as a hard copy, or in visual or audio format. Any details that can be used to identify a person or which can be related to an identifiable person are classed as personal data and are covered by the Act.

**Data Subject:** Data Subject is the term used to describe the individual whose personal data is being collected and used.
**Data Controller:** The Data Controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
**Data Processor:** Data Processor means any person or organization who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.

### Special category data
The data protection legislation classifies some personal data as being particularly sensitive. Special category data refers to any details which could be more detrimental to the individual if the data is misused.

**Special category data is defined as:**
- Trade-union membership
- Sex life and sexual orientation
- Genetic or biometric data
- Racial or ethnic origin
- Health and medical data
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Political opinions

Note that the legislation puts additional safeguards in place around the use of what it classes as special category data. Credit references and bank details are not classed as special category data. Sensitive financial data is subject to different safeguards, within financial services regulations.

### Data protection principles
Take a few minutes to review the six principles of the GDPR. These may be familiar to you, as they have formed the core principles of all data protection legislation in the UK. These principles relate to the collection, use, storage, and disposal of personal information and are the foundation of good data protection practice.

**The six principles are:**
- Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Accuracy
- Storage limitation
- Integrity and confidentiality (security)

Organizations must be able to demonstrate how they comply with these 6 principles.

**Principle 1 - Lawfulness, fairness and transparency:** Personal information must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. This means that data subjects must be kept informed about how and why their personal data is processed as well as requiring the processing to be lawful.

**Principle 2 - Purpose limitation:** Data must be collected for a specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose. It should not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with this purpose.

**Principle 3 - Data minimization:** Personal information must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is being processed. Personal data should never be recorded simply on the basis that it might be useful in the future. There must be a clear link between what the purpose of the processing is and what data is actually processed.

**Principle 4 - Accuracy:** The data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.

**Principle 5 - Storage limitation:** Personal information must not be kept for longer than is necessary.

**Principle 6 - Integrity and confidentiality (security):** The data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal information. This includes using appropriate technical or organizational measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

### What rights do data subjects have?
Data protection legislation gives rights to individuals relating to the personal data that organizations hold about them.

- The right to be told how their data is being used
- The right to gain access to their data
- The right to request corrections to their data
- The right to request deletion of their data
- The

 right to request restrictions on how their data is processed
- In some circumstances, the right to request their data be passed on to other organizations
- The right to object to how their data is used
- The right to query automated decisions made based on their data

### Additional points to consider
The University has a classification system for all the data it processes, which includes commercially sensitive as well as personal data. While this training focuses on personal data it is important to understand the principles for protecting other classified data as well. Refer to the Information Protection Policy for more detail.

## Scenario
Let’s look at an example of an individual who has concerns about how their personal data is being used.

- Kazia is aware that the University holds some sensitive and personal information about her.
- She is alarmed by an article she has read and stories she has heard about a data breach. The article claims that the personal data of hundreds of students has been published online.
- Kazia decides to call the University to question what data it holds on her, and how it is being used.

**Which of the following do you think apply to Kazia? (Tip: Consider the rights that data subjects have.)**
1. The University must supply Kazia with the information that she is requesting
2. Kazia has the right to know how long the information will be kept on file
3. If necessary, Kazia can ask for her personal information to be updated

**How did you answer?** In this scenario, Kazia is the data subject and she has the right to:
1. know what personal information the University has on file about her
2. ask for the information to be updated
3. know how long the information will be retained

The University cannot charge for providing Kazia with this information.

## Day to day data protection

### Who is responsible for data protection within the University?
Everyone who accesses information has some responsibility for ensuring that we comply with the legislation and with the University's policies.

**The University:** The University is the data controller. This means that the University is legally responsible for ensuring that its use of personal and sensitive information complies with all aspects of the legislation. This includes a requirement for the University to ensure that all staff who have access to, or handle, personal or sensitive information know how to do so safely and legally.

**Line managers:** Line managers are responsible for ensuring that their staff receive appropriate training and are provided with appropriate equipment to enable them to comply with the legislation.

**All employees:** All employees have a responsibility to comply with the legislation and with University procedures. They can do this by following our data protection policies and procedures and reporting any concerns or data breaches. Employees who deliberately or negligently fail to follow policies and procedures could be subject to disciplinary action. Any misuse of information for personal gain may result in a criminal investigation.

### How does the University ensure compliance with data protection legislation?
Relevant policies and data protection training play a key role in ensuring that the University remains compliant with the legislation. The University's Data Protection website is a good source of information.

The University has key people who have specific responsibilities relating to data protection compliance. In addition to your line manager, these are people who can provide guidance on data protection issues.

**Data Protection Officer:** The Data Protection Officer advises the University about and monitors compliance. The University's Data Protection Office can be reached at dpo@leeds.ac.uk.

**Senior Information Risk Owner:** The Senior Information Risk Owner ensures that the University identifies, addresses, and manages risks to personal and sensitive information. Responsibility is shared between the University Secretary and the Chief Operating Officer.

**Information Asset Owners:** All classified data should have a designated information asset owner. All staff members are responsible for complying with data protection policies.

**Information Governance Team:** The University's Information Governance Team addresses day-to-day compliance with legislation and University policies, including responding to requests made in accordance with individuals' rights; managing incidents; providing guidance and advice; maintaining policies and procedures and risk assessments.

### All in a day's work
When working to tight deadlines and under pressure, it’s important that we are constantly vigilant about how we work, particularly in relation to data protection. This involves following some best practice principles when handling hard copy and electronic information.

Policies and procedures also need to be adhered to when working from home. We would expect colleagues to generate less hard copy data when they are away from the office but it is really important that you think carefully about how you are managing and saving electronic data when you are working from home. If you are working on a computer from home you must make sure that it is encrypted (contact IT Service Desk if you are unsure).
